# cats-site
 
This is my site I made that is dedicated for all things cats!

It does use some css for styling. Bootstrap is also used.

Frankly, I forgot most of what I wrote here since this was coded a long time ago.

Here is a sample of what I made.

Check the source file if you want to view the full site! Also, this was made when I was fairly new to web development and it took a long time to make this. So some of the elements in the site do not look right.
